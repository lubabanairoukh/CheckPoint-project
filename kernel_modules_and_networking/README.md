## First Module

 Yaniv is using mint cinnamon linux
and Lubaba using a clean ubunto image

from:
sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install kmod linux-headers-5.4.0-80-generic
```

it was needed to restart the vm after installing the headers for linux/init
to not throw compiliation error

created the make file with the given instruction

```bash
obj-m += first_module.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

than did:

```bash
sudo insmod first_module.ko
```

```bash
dmesg | tail
```

[ 1026.162937] Basic Module: Loaded successfully!

```bash
sudo rmmod first_module
```

[ 1141.683887] Basic Module: Unloaded successfully!

now we can clean that make file cus it really disgusting

```bash
make clean
```

in order to push in this linux we must setup:
 git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

## Second Module

  important explanation on every part of the example code

 ```c
  static unsigned int packet_hook(void *priv, struct sk_buff *skb, const struct nf_hook_state *state) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter Module: Packet intercepted.\n");
    return NF_ACCEPT; // Accept the packet to continue its path
}
```

## Function Signature

The hook function must match a specific signature defined by Netfilter to be compatible with the framework.

- **priv**: A pointer to private data, not used here.
- **skb**: A pointer to the `struct sk_buff` which represents the network packet, skb stands for "socket buffer".
- **state**: Contains information about the packet and the hook point.
- **printk**: Logs a message each time a packet is processed by this hook.
- **Return Value**: `NF_ACCEPT` tells Netfilter to allow the packet to proceed. Other values like `NF_DROP` can be used to drop the packet.
for more info i found this source:

[netfilter-hacking-HOWTO](https://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/netfilter-hacking-HOWTO.txt)


![alt text](image.png)

```c
static struct nf_hook_ops nfho = {
    .hook = packet_hook,           // Pointer to the hook function
    .pf = PF_INET,                 // IPv4 protocol family
    .hooknum = NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING, // First hook in Netfilter IPv4 (when packet arrives)
    .priority = NF_IP_PRI_FIRST,   // Set the highest priority over all other hook functions
};
```

- **hook**: This is a pointer to the function to call when the conditions are met.
- **pf**: Protocol family, set to `PF_INET` for IPv4. For IPv6, you would use `PF_INET6`.

IPv4 and IPv6 are two different versions of the Internet Protocol. They are both used to send packets of data across the Internet. The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the number of IP addresses they can support. 
IPv4 using 32 bits, IPv6 using 128 bits.
there are also more differnces between them,security, routing, and network configuration.
You can read more about it [Understanding the Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6](https://www.siteground.com/kb/ipv4-vs-ipv6/#Understanding_IPv4_and_IPv6)

- **hooknum**: Defines at which point in the packet processing this hook will be called. `NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING` is the point just after the packet is received. BASICLY THE LOCATION OF THE FILTER, CHECK THE GRAPH IN THE CHECKPOINT PRESENTATION

- **priority**: Determines the order of calling when multiple hooks exist for the same hook point. IN CASE WE HAVE MULTIPLY HOOKS ON THE SAME SPOT, WHICH ONE SHOULD BE FIRST? LAST?


```c
static int __init my_netfilter_init(void) {
    nf_register_net_hook(&init_net, &nfho); // Register the hook
    printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter Module: Loaded and hook registered.\n");
    return 0;
}

static void __exit my_netfilter_exit(void) {
    nf_unregister_net_hook(&init_net, &nfho); // Unregister the hook
    printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter Module: Unloaded and hook unregistered.\n");
}
```

- **nf_register_net_hook & nf_unregister_net_hook**: These functions register and unregister your hook with the Netfilter framework.
- **init_net**: Represents the network namespace; `init_net` is the initial network namespace, basically connect the hook to the default global network of the system.
- **nfho**: The hook structure we defined earlier with the hook and other parameters as described above.

- **Initialization and Cleanup Functions**: Marked with `__init` and `__exit` to indicate to the kernel that these functions are only used at initialization or cleanup time, which can help to save memory.


## Expand our third Module esp the hook function

```c
static unsigned int packet_hook(void *priv,
                                struct sk_buff *skb,
                                const struct nf_hook_state *state)
{
    
    struct iphdr *ip_header = ip_hdr(skb);
    
    if(ip_header)
    {
        unsigned int source = ip_header->saddr;
        unsigned int dest = ip_header->daddr;
        
    printk(KERN_INFO "Source IP: %pI4\n", &source);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Destination IP: %pI4\n", &dest);
       
    }
    
    printk(KERN_INFO "our netfilter is very complicated\n");
    printk(KERN_INFO "Netfilter Module: Packet intercepted.\n");
    return NF_ACCEPT; // Accept the packet to continue its path
}
```

the only differnece is :

```c
 struct iphdr *ip_header = ip_hdr(skb);
    
    if(ip_header)
    {
        unsigned int source = ip_header->saddr;
        unsigned int dest = ip_header->daddr;
        
    printk(KERN_INFO "Source IP: %pI4\n", &source);
    printk(KERN_INFO "Destination IP: %pI4\n", &dest);
       
    }
```

- **ip_hdr**: A helper function to extract the IP header from the socket buffer structure (SKB).
ip_hdr as the following members:
 
```c
ip_header->check; //checksum error checking with bits
ip_header->frag_off; //fragment offset
ip_header->id; //identification
ip_header->ihl; //internet header length
ip_header->protocol; //protocol tcp=6, udp=17 /in.h to see all defines
ip_header->tos; //type of service
ip_header->tot_len; //total length
ip_header->ttl; //time to live (how many hops the packet can go through)
ip_header->version //ipv4 or ipv6
```

example of tracert to under ttl 
basicly we go through many hops till we reach the destination (in this case www.google.com)

## Fourth Module

so our first idea, was to locate malicious/violent/bad data in the packets, and drop them.
we soon realized that its very complicated, to extract the data, and to compare it, against actual strings like "violent" "gambling" etc, cus the data itself is in binary format, and the extraction itself, is complicated enough.

than after talking with the mentors, we decided to go to a simpler approach, and we choose to block packets from specifc ranges of ip addresses.

### important 

in order to convert ip adress into u32 so we can compare it, with the ip_header->saddr for example, 
we have two important functions:

htonl()
function: htonl() stands for "host to network long."
Purpose: Converts a 32-bit integer from the host's byte order to network byte order.
Use Case: It's used when integers are sent over the network to ensure that the receiver interprets the bytes correctly regardless of its native byte order. Network byte order is defined to be big-endian, which means the most significant byte is transmitted first.

and 

ntohl()
Function: ntohl() stands for "network to host long."
Purpose: Converts a 32-bit integer from network byte order to the host's native byte order.
Use Case: It's used when receiving integers over the network to convert them from the standard network byte order to the host’s byte order, allowing the program running on the host to correctly handle the received data.

At the end after talking with Eitan, we dont need to use this function he suggested to use in_aton
which transfer a string of an ip "1.1.1.1" to __be32 
than we can stright compare the ip_header->saddr with the __be32 ip address

example:

```c
char* ip = "8.8.8.8";
        __be32 block_ip = in_aton(ip);
        if(ip_header->saddr == block_ip)
        {
            printk(KERN_INFO "Blocked IP: %pI4\n", &ip_header->saddr);
            return NF_DROP;
        }
```


## Update to Part Three: Octet-by-Octet Comparison

After discussing the previous solution with the mentors, I implemented a second method for comparing the source IP with the CIDR blocks. Instead of directly comparing the full IP addresses, I opted to compare each of the four octets (A.B.C.D) individually.

### The New Approach:

The idea was to split both the source IP (`ip_header->saddr`) and the CIDR block's first and last addresses into four separate octets and compare them one by one. This method was intended to provide better precision when determining if an IP falls within the desired range.

You can see the implementation in `netfilter_module_2.c`

### Remaining Issues:

While this approach offers more control and appeared to be an improvement, it didn’t fully resolve the problem. In some cases, the comparison didn’t yield correct results, and certain packets weren’t blocked as expected. I suspect this issue may be related to how the octets are processed or how the CIDR blocks are handled, requiring further debugging and refinement.
